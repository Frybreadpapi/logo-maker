## Description

Why did you build this project? I built this project for people that want to try out an intergrated terminal in vs code and see what things it mught have to offer.
What did you learn? I learned a lot about about inquirer, jest, and node. and some of the functions these they have.

## Installation

Node, inquirer and Jest was installed and used in the intergrated terminal. If you was to do this on your local device you would also have to do the same.

## Usage

## Credits

Credits to multiple articles on stack overflow, w3schools, and also multiple youtube videos for helping me get things right when I ran into problems. Some of my peers also helped me out when the articles and videos were not helpful.
